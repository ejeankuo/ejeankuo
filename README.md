# :hibiscus: About Me!
Hi! I'm Ejean Kuo, a student at Northwestern University studying Computer Science and English Literature.
- :sunny: I'm currently based in Evanston, IL, but I'm originally from SF, CA :cityscape:.
- :books: Right now, I'm working on [Ranklit](https://github.com/ejeankuo/book-ranker), a social iOS app that allows users to comparatively rank books they've read, ultimately generating an automated score for each book on a scale of 1 to 10. :star::star::star::star::star:
